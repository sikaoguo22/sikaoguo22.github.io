I work at [Johnson Lab](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/johnson-lab/) as a postdoc now. I develop model and simulation techniques to study protein assembly processes. If interested, feel free to email me at [sikaoguo@gmail.com](mailto:sikaoguo@gmail.com).

I graduated from [School of Physics](https://physics.nankai.edu.cn/wlxyen/main.htm), Nankai University with a bachelor's degree and from [Institute of Physics](http://english.iop.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences with a PhD degree, advised by [Ping Xie](http://english.iop.cas.cn/pe/?id=604).
