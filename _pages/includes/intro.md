I work at [Johnson Lab](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/johnson-lab/) as a postdoc now. I develop model techniques to study how protein assembly control the biological processes such as endocytosis and viral exit. If interested, feel free to email me at [sikaoguo@gmail.com](mailto:sikaoguo@gmail.com).

I graduated from [School of Physics](https://physics.nankai.edu.cn/wlxyen/main.htm), Nankai University with a bachelor's degree and from [Institute of Physics](http://english.iop.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences with a PhD degree, advised by [Ping Xie](http://english.iop.cas.cn/pe/?id=604). 

My research interest is computational biophysics. The transport of nutrients into our cells and the viral budding out of the cell both require to cross the membrane. In both cases the membrane will be reshaped to a vesicle because of the self-assembly of the different protein components. The dynamics of self-assembly in the cell are challenging to simulate because it involves both fast molecule motion and slow collective dynamics. I developed model techniques to study the control and spatio-temporal dynamics of these assembly problems. I am broadly interested in how key features of dimensionality and component stoichiometry controls assembly in these cellular pathways, such as [endocytosis](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009969) and [infectious viral formation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.21.517392v1.abstract).
